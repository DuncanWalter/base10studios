<p>Our mission is to bring the creative power of code to everyone. That includes you (yes, you). If you are new to programming, I recommend giving this a read. It is a curated list of pointers and resources we used to get where we are today (mixed in with some cool starter project ideas). From the top:</p>

<!-- <h6><strong>Computer Science Fundamentals and Practice:</strong></h6> -->

<h6 class="center-align"><strong>RESOURCE: MIT OCW intro to computer science:</strong></h6>
<p>This is a series of recorded lectures provided online for free by none other than MIT. In case the significance of that went over your head, anything computer related attached to MIT is probably worth a look. This class certainly falls into that look-worthy catagory. It is taught through the programming language Python, an untyped scripting language (lots of jargon, I know) and a very good place to start. The first half of this class is applicable to virtually every language, paradigm, and project I ever encountered or heard of. Anyone new--or even just untrained--in computer science would benefit greatly from listening to these lectures. As an added bonus, the professor does a good job with the class and you shouldn't find yourself all too bored.</p>

<h6 class="center-align"><strong>RESOURCE: IDEs and Editors:</strong></h6>
<p>Before doing any serious work in any language, snag some code editing software. There are two main schools of thought to consider when picking this software: IDE and Editor. IDE stands for interactive developement environment. These tend to feature static code analyzers (they help you code as you type) and nice friendly buttons. On the downside, they can feel a bit cumbersome for trully expert programmers. These code gurus tend to instead use specialized text editors, which come with spartan features. These programmers will make more use of the terminal when programming, and will potentially have more difficulty in debugging typos. For novice to intermediate level programmers, I advise making heavy use of IDEs. That being said, use the text editors in a suplementary fassion; they are quite refreshing to use. As for which IDEs and editors to pick, remember that is your choice. That being said, I'm going to pummel you with opinions. For IDEs, I recommend using the free community (or awesome student) versions of InteliJ and/or WebStorm- these are both made by JetBrains in order to edit a wide range of languages. You can't really go wrong with most JetBrains products in my experience. As for editors, Sublime is certainly worthy of an honerable mention. However, it should be noted that one of its alternatives, Atom, isn't far behind on OSs other than Windows (Atom is a little slow in general, but it's way worse in Windows). Equipped with editing software, the real fun can begin.</p>

<h6 class="center-align"><strong>OPINION: Master JavaScript First:</strong></h6>
<p>As I see it, we should all become masters of JavaScript before any other language. Despite the allergic reaction programmers in the Java/C++ bubble often have to JavaScript, it has become the most used language around the world. Anymore, it SHOULD be regarded as a premier languages. So what makes it uniquely awesome as an educational tool? Firstly, it's dead simple when running small programs and it has a tiny vocabulary. Moreover, it runs uncompiled which encourages beginners to run code often and allows them to quickly correct mistakes. These convieniences are backed by mountains of online resources for learning JavaScript- more than any other language, I expect. The other nifty thing about JavaScript is that it provides a good foundation for most other forms of programming. It is simultaneously imperitive, functional, object oriented, asynchronous, and nowadays even capable of concurrency. This will prevent your first functional language from melting your noggin further down the road. This accessiblility and flexibility make JavaScript a very atractive first language.</p>

<h6 class="center-align"><strong>RESOURCE: CodeFights.com:</strong></h6>
<p>This is a a website we stumbled across quite recently. It has three key features for programming upstarts: the arcade, the quizzes, and the bots. The arcade is a treasure trove of quirky little code challenges that force some lateral thinking and emphasize important skills. Next up are the quizzes. These range in subject matter from algorithm complexity (important and reasonable) to code architecture (I guessed on 90% of the questions). Bearing that in mind, they provide great metrics for how much (and often how little) you actually know about programming. They also show off just how broad the field of computer science is. This brings us to the bots. They are created by evaluating software engineers at a company on a set of company-specific problems. In turn, these problems become the challenges in a competition against the bot. Your resulting score compared with the bot's score is supposed to be indicative of your skill when compared to their top engineers. I assume this is a great way of deflating a bloated ego, but to be honest, I haven't had the time to put into one of these duels yet; the idea just fascinates me.</p>
