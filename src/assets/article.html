<!-- <p>Our mission is to bring the creative power of code to everyone. That includes you (yes, you). If you are new to programming, I recommend giving this a read. It is a curated list of pointers and resources we used to get where we are today (mixed in with some cool starter project ideas). From the top:</p>

<p>Any good list of amazing things about computer science should begin and end with how unbelievably accessible it is. Given a computer, you (yes, YOU) can utilize programming skills to make anything. Here at Base[10], we want to make those programming skills as available and widespread as possible, so we made this colection of ideas and tools for beginner-to-intermediate level progrrammers.</p>

<h6 class="center-align"><strong>MIT OCW: Intro To Computer Science</strong></h6>
<p>MIT created a series of free online lectures covering the fundamentals of computer science a few years ago. The material covered, especially in the earlier lectures, aplies directly to virtually all things computer science. Anyone new to--or even just untrained in--computer science should probably consider giving these lectures a look.</p>

<h6 class="center-align"><strong>IDEs and Editors</strong></h6>
<p>Before attempting serious work in any language, snag some code editing software. This software comes in two main catagories: IDE and Editor. IDE stands for interactive developement environment. These tend to feature static code analyzers (they help you code as you type) and nice friendly buttons. On the downside, they can feel a bit cumbersome for very experienced programmers. These code gurus sometimes instead use specialized text editors, which come with minimal features. Editors are great for programmers who are comfortable in a terminal and familiar with the syntax of their programming language. For novice to intermediate level programmers, I advise making heavier use of IDEs and playing with text editors on the side. As for which IDEs and editors to pick, that's your choice... However, I'm going to pummel you with opinions anyway. For IDEs, I recommend using the free community version of InteliJ and/or WebStorm- these are both made by JetBrains and are excellent tools for editting a wide range of languages. As for editors, Sublime gets my humble reccomendation. It's simple, easy-to-learn, and ubiquitous.</p>

<h6 class="center-align"><strong>JavaScript First</strong></h6>
<p>As I see it, we should all become masters of JavaScript before any other language. After some awkward transition years, it has emerged as one of the premier languages used around the globe. When compared to it's contemporaries in sheer popularity--Java, Python, and the C derivatives--Javascript also offers a few other benefits as an educational tool. For starters, it has a tiny vocabulary. This makes learning all the ins and outs of JS a little bit nicer on begginers than, say, Scala. Moreover, it runs uncompiled. This encourages programmers to run code often and speeds up the debugging loop. These convieniences are backed by mountains of online resources for learning JavaScript- the JS community is lush and vibrant. The last nifty thing about JavaScript is that it provides a broader footprint in computer science than most other languages. It is simultaneously imperitive, functional, object oriented, asynchronous, and nowadays even capable of concurrency. This will prevent your first functional language from melting your noggin. This accessiblility and flexibility make JavaScript a very atractive first language.</p>

<h6 class="center-align"><strong>CodeFights</strong></h6>
<p>This is a a website we stumbled across quite recently. It has three key features for programming upstarts: the arcade, the quizzes, and the bots. The arcade is a treasure trove of quirky little code challenges that force some lateral thinking and emphasize important skills. Next up are the quizzes. These range in subject matter from algorithm complexity (important and reasonable) to code architecture (I guessed on 90% of the questions). Bearing that in mind, they provide great metrics for how much (and often how little) you actually know about programming. They also show off just how broad the field of computer science is. This brings us to the bots. They are created by evaluating software engineers at a company on a set of company-specific problems. In turn, these problems become the challenges in a competition against the bot. Your resulting score compared with the bot's score is supposed to be indicative of your skill when compared to their top engineers. I assume this is a great way of deflating a bloated ego, but to be honest, I haven't had the time to put into one of these duels yet; the idea just fascinates me.</p>
