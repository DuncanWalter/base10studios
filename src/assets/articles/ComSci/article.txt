<p>Any list of amazing things about computer science should begin and end with how unbelievably accessible it is. Given a computer, you (yes, YOU) can utilize programming skills to make virtually anything. Here at Base[10], we want to make those programming skills as available and widespread as possible. With that in mind, we made this collection of ideas and tools for beginner-level programmers (and people who don't know they're programmers yet).</p>

<p class="center-align"><strong>MIT OCW: Intro To Computer Science</strong></p>
<p>MIT created a series of free online lectures covering the fundamentals of computer science a few years ago. The material covered, especially in the earlier lectures, applies directly to all things computer science. Anyone new to—or even just untrained in—computer science should give these lectures a watch. The class pace is fast, and the material is all presented in engaging fashion. In fact, the obscurity of this course is what inspired this article in the first place.</p>

<p class="center-align"><strong>IDEs and Editors</strong></p>
<p>Before attempting more serious work in any language, snag some code editing software. This software comes in two main categories: IDE and Editor. IDE stands for interactive development environment. These tend to feature static code analyzers (they help you code as you type) and nice friendly buttons. On the downside, they can feel a bit cumbersome for very experienced programmers. These code gurus sometimes instead use specialized text editors, which come with minimal features. Editors are great for programmers who are comfortable in a terminal and familiar with the syntax of their programming language. For novice to intermediate level programmers, I advise making heavier use of IDEs and playing with text editors on the side. As for which IDEs and editors to pick, that's your choice... However, I'm going to pummel you with opinions anyway. For IDEs, I recommend using the free community version of InteliJ and/or WebStorm- these are both made by JetBrains and are excellent tools for editing a wide range of languages. As for editors, Sublime and Atom are each fantastic and free.</p>

<p class="center-align"><strong>CodeFights.com</strong></p>
<p>This is a website we encountered more recently. It has three key features for programming upstarts: the arcade, quizzes, and bots. The arcade is a treasure trove of quirky little code challenges that force some lateral thinking and emphasize important skills. Next up are the quizzes. These range in subject matter from algorithm complexity (important and reasonable) to code architecture (I guessed on 90% of the questions). Bearing that in mind, they provide great metrics for how much (and often how little) you actually know about programming. They also show off just how broad the field of computer science is. This brings us to the bots. They are created by evaluating software engineers at a company with a set of company-specific problems. In turn, these problems become the challenges in a competition against the bot. Your resulting score compared with the bot's score is supposed to be indicative of your skill when compared to their top engineers. This is a great way of deflating a bloated ego. It is also the best indicator of ability in my opinion; these challenges are not to be taken lightly.</p>
